* Cheese: A Chess AI

This is my project for [[https://www.cs.csustan.edu/~mmartin/4480/][CS 4480: Artificial Intelligence]].

** How to build / run
TO build, you'll need

- GHC
- The Stack build tool

After installing those two, use stack to install all dependencies with ~stack
build~.
There should be an executable called ~stack-exe~ in your path. Currently the only
way to run the AI is move-by-move, from the REPL.

You'll need to start up the GHC repl, specifically ~stack ghci~.

Then load the file with ~:l Cheese~.

Start with ~findAiMove initialBoard~, and from there you get back a ~GameTree~,
which you can reference with ~it~. So now, use ~nextMove <piece> <from> <to>
it~. Take a look at the comment with the numbered board so that you know from
where to where.

That's it. There is a bug with the opponent's captures not always capturing.
